Satelistica
===========

A version of "predict4Java" for the Processing environment. It tracks objects in orbit above the earth in real time and treturns processing-friendly data.
The way of using it is simple: you define a location and a url to a TLE (Orbital elements or the data which describes a satellite orbit) data set. See the examples to get an overview.

Attention!!!
This version is built on Processing core 1.5.1. The working version of this library was needed to work with the arduino library and this was not supported on 2.0b6 when I started.


How to Install:

Copy the folder "satelistica" to the libraries folder of processing. Restart or launch Processing 1.5.1
