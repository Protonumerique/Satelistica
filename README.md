Satelistica
===========

A version of "predict4Java" for the Processing environment. It tracks objects in orbit above the earth and visualize their activity in real time.

Attention!!!
This version is still built on Processing core 1.5.1. The working version of this library is needed to work with arduino and this was not supported on 2.0 when I started.

How to Install:

Copy the folder "satelistica" to the libraries folder of processing. Restart or launch Processing 1.5.1
